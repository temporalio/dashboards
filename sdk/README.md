# Temporal Grafana SDK Dashboards

This repository contains two dashboards: 
- `temporal-sdk-go-java.json` for [Go](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-go) and [Java](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-java) SDKs

- `temporal-sdk-core.json` for [Core](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-core) based SDKs. In Core based SDKs, metrics of the type Histogram 
are measured in milliseconds by default, so the dashboard is configured accordingly to display them in milliseconds.
