# Temporal Grafana Dashboards

This repository contains community-driven Grafana dashboards that can be used for monitoring 
Temporal Server and SDK metrics. 

We welcome contributions to existing as well as new dashboards that can help the community.

Note that the intent for these dashboards is not to be used in production. They 
are here to provide out-of-the-box community dashboards you can use to learn from and could be a  
possible baseline for your monitoring efforts.

Also note that we do not test these dashboards on all Grafana and Temporal server versions.
If you encounter some errors/issues please report them by opening and issue in this repository.

## Directory structure

* "server": includes dashboards for Temporal Server metrics
