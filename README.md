# Temporal Grafana Dashboards

This repository contains community-driven Grafana [dashboards](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/) that can be used for monitoring 
Temporal Server and SDK metrics. 

We welcome contributions to existing as well as new dashboards that can help the community.

- ⚠️ Note that the intent for these dashboards is not to be used in production. They are here to provide out-of-the-box community dashboards you can learn from and use as a baseline for your monitoring efforts.
- Also note that we do not test these dashboards on all Grafana and Temporal Server versions. If you encounter any issues please report them by opening [an issue](https://github.com/temporalio/dashboards/issues/new) in this repository.
